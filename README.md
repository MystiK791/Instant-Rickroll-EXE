# Instant Rickroll EXE
 A fully-realize version of my Instant Rickroll prototype from a year ago

## Disclaimer
This repo DOES include a .mp4 of the official "Never Gonna Give You Up" music video (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). If Rick Astley or his record label has a problem with this, I will remove the video from the repo and rewrite the instructions to include obtaining and zipping your own copy.

## Functionality

## Building
1. Install Python 3.9 or later
2. Install auto-py-to-exe and run it
3. Load the build.json file
4. Point the program to main.py if it isn't already
5. Verify that the files audio.mp3 and video.mp4 are set to be added to the EXE
6. Set the icon to whatever you want
7. Build!

## Customizing
If you want to customize the icon, you have 2 options:
1. Use Resource Hacker to replace the ico of the EXE manually
2. Follow the steps above to build from source with a custom ico

## Enjoy!
